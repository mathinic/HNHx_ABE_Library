# HNHx_ABE_Library
Scripts for the analysis of sequence reads from the HNHxABE self-targeting library

Sequencing files (fastq.gz) are first merged and trimmed with Flash and Cutadapt (01_Flash_Cutadapt_Script.sh).
Afterwards trimmed files are evaluated for editing and output stored in a final .csv file (02_HNH_Library_SequenceRead_Analysis.py).
